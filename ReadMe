This repository contains the source code, datasets, and implementation scripts for the Shopping Bot Development Project.
It showcases our expertise in robotics, automation, and web application development. The shopping bot is designed to 
revolutionize in-store shopping by leveraging technologies like line-following navigation, QR code scanning, and customer 
interaction through a Flask-based web interface.

The bot integrates Raspberry Pi and Arduino for seamless communication between sensors, motors, and the control system.
Highlights include autonomous navigation, real-time product retrieval, and interactive web functionalities. 
This project demonstrates practical applications of IoT, computer vision, and robotics for improving retail experiences.
